ðŸ“Œ TimeUp Project Prompt
Project Title:
TimeUp â€” Workday Time Calculator (Blazor Web App)

Project Type:
Blazor Web App (.NET 9)

ðŸ“– Project Overview:
Build a Blazor Web App named TimeUp that helps office employees calculate their leaving (out) time based on:

Their in-time (arrival time)

Total break duration

Required work duration (excluding breaks)

The system should allow the user to select their working duration (like 9 hours, 10 hours) via a dropdown, input their in-time, and input the number and duration of breaks they took.
The app then calculates and displays their expected out-time based on the total work time required excluding breaks.

âœ… Features:
In-Time Input:
Users can enter their office in-time using a time picker.

Select Work Duration:
A dropdown for choosing fixed working durations (e.g. 9 hours, 10 hours, etc.)

Add Breaks:
User can enter how many breaks they took, and input minutes for each break individually.

Calculate Out-Time:
The app computes the expected out-time by adding the required work duration (excluding break time) to the in-time.

Clean Responsive UI:
Use Blazor Components with input fields, dropdowns, and a clear results section.

ðŸ“Œ Technical Requirements:
Blazor Web App with .NET 9

Use TimeOnly type for in-time and out-time calculations

Use TimeSpan for break durations and work durations

Blazor interactive server render mode (@rendermode InteractiveServer)

Razor Components for modular, reusable UI

Proper Program.cs with AddRazorComponents() and AddInteractiveServerComponents()

Clean _Imports.razor for common namespaces:

razor
Copy
Edit
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing
Correct App.razor with:

r
Copy
Edit
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
    <Found Context="routeData">
        <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" />
    </Found>
    <NotFound>
        <LayoutView>
            <p>Sorry, nothing found at this address.</p>
        </LayoutView>
    </NotFound>
</Router>
Ensure clean dotnet build without duplicate @using statements

ðŸ“Š Summary:
This app simplifies daily office routines by automating out-time calculations based on actual working and break times.
The goal is to improve work-life balance tracking and time management.

Note:
The entire project must strictly follow clean Blazor component architecture, proper namespace management, and .NET 9 compatibility.
